Notes for developing AutoWrap
=============================
This file contains some notes on how to understand and how to extend
AutoWrap's code. It also contains some warnings and design issues.

Terminology
-----------
Some terms as they're used in the documentation:
 * native code: Means C++ code (opposed to CLR code). This is the code from which the CLR
     code will be generated.
 * CLR code: Means C++/CLR (.NET) code (opposed to native code). This is the code that will
     be generated.
 * Producing: A synonym for "generating"; i.e. we have "code producers" (and not "code generators).


Lazy-evaluating of properties
-----------------------------
Many properties of the definition classes (like "ClassDefinition" or "MemberMehodDefinition")
are evaluated first when needed. Here's an example:

  private AbstractTypeDefinition _memberType;
  public AbstractTypeDefinition MemberType {
    get {
      if (_memberType == null) {
        // Initialization code here
        ...
      }

      return _memberType;
    }
  }

So, the value of "_memberType" is NOT set within the constructor which would seem to be
a viable (and better) alternative. 

The reason why it's done in the properties access and not in the constructor is that the
initialization code examines some type definition that hasn't been loaded yet (which then
leads to a KeyNotFoundException). Such problems arise for example when a Class A is being
loaded and one of A's fields is of type B which hasn't been loaded yet. To make things more
complicate one of B's fields could be of type A and this circular reference could not be
resolved in a constructor of either class definitions.

So to prevent such problems from occuring, lazy property evaluation (as seen in the code
above) is used.


Customizing the output
----------------------
There are (besides the "Attribute.xml" file) a few classes that allow tweaking the output:

 * MetaConstructFactory : allows to create custom subclasses of the definition classes
 * CodeStyleDefinition : allows to tweak some settings regarding the generated code (like
                         naming or whitespacing).

Attributes
----------
Each attribute has its own class. The name of the class is the attribute name with the
word "Attribute" appended (like "IgnoreAttribute" for "Ignore"). Moreover the following
requirements must be met:

 * The file must (should) be place in the folder "Meta\Attributes"
 * The class must inherit from "AutoWrapAttribute"
 * The class must be defined in the same namespace as "AutoWrapAttribute"

The code for finding the type of a certain attribute is located in "AutoWrapAttribute.FindAttribute()".


File writing
------------
For every one of OGRE's .h files a MOGRE .h file and (in most cases) a MOGRE .cpp file will
be generated (called "produced" here). The entry method for the generation process is
"Wrapper.GenerateCodeFiles()".

The class used to write the actual code is "SourceCodeStringBuilder". This class is used
by all code producer classes to produce their code.

What code will be produced for each single type is determined by the code producer class
used for this type. All code producing classes can be found in "Meta\CodeProducers". Classes
whose name ends with "InclProducer" will produce ".h" files, classes whose name ends with
"CppProducer" will produce ".cpp" files.
